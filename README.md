## About Project

A project implemented as part of a study of React and TypeScript. The user has the ability to register and add an employee/client to a shared table. The user can also delete and edit added objects. The user can only interact with the objects he has added. The rest of the objects he can only view.

The application has its own server where the database of the added employees/clients will be stored

## Project Stack

`react`, `redux toolkit`, `typescript`, `node.js`, `express`, `prisma`, `ant design`

## If you want to run the project on your PC

1. Download the project on a PC
2. Open the project in vs code (or any other development environment)
3. Open the console at the root of the project and type `npm install` to install all the dependencies for the server to work
4. Next, open the console in the **client** folder and repeat the `npm install` command to install all the dependencies to run the frontend part of the application
5. Now go back to the root of the application, open the console and use the command `npm run dev`. This will run backend and frontend together
6. You can also enter `npx prisma studio` in the console to interact with the database directly
